# Persona 3 Reload

A recreation of the main pause menu in Persona 3 Reload.

## Fun Facts

* The water on the top is a WebGL shader written by a friend of mine
* The SFX were ripped straight from a recording of the game with BGM off
* The screenshot is from December ingame, after about 60 hours of playtime
* While P3R uses a customized font that is disallowed for redistribution, the font used here is just Roboto, which is a close enough match
